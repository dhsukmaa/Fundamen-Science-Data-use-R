I took this class during semester 4. In this class we’re discusses about machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised. This folder contains some assignments from this class.
1.	Statistika  (submission on : 14/10/2020)
2.	Logistic Regression(submission on : 24/10/2020)
3.	Linear Regression (submission on : 24/10/2020)
4.	K-Means(submission on : 20/11/2020)
5.	Naïve Bayes (submission on : 24/10/2020)
6.	Support vector machine(submission on : 01/11/2020)


This submission still has many drawbacks because this is my first time learning machine learning.
